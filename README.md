# `ansible-generate`

So you want to create a new ansible role! How do you create it?

Well, you could use `ansible-galaxy init`, but what if you cant a slightly different skeleton? Perhaps you want your team to have a `CONTRIBUTING.md` in all repos.

Well, with `ansible-generate`, you can.

Just run:

```
bin/ansible-generate your-role-name
```
